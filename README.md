In this project, we analyze a dataset of customer orders provided by Digikala, a leading e-commerce company. By applying the Apriori and FPGrowth algorithms, we identify frequent patterns in customer orders and calculate the Support and Confidence measures for the discovered patterns. Additionally, we assess the importance and attractiveness of these patterns using metrics such as Lift, ùúí2, and Imbalance Ratio. Furthermore, we incorporate geographical information (city_name_fa column) and categorize the important discovered patterns based on the customers' residential locations
